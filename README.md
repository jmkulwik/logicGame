logicGame
=========

Purpose:  
Help middle school students make the jump from block-based pre-made programming to text-based programming. 
    Secondary goal: reinforce basic logic concepts

The game flows through a series of progressively more difficult levels   
Each level includes:   
A basic logic true/false grid and a set of conditions (written in pseudocode) that allow the player to correctly fill in the grid - each condition will have a translation into "normal english" when the mouse hovers over it
  
If a student correctly answers, they may move on to the next level, 
Otherwise, the level will repeat itself with an option for hints
